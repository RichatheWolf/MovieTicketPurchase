PMR: Movie Ticket Purchase
-- this code was not difficult, but I added a couple extra lines to add a realistic feel to the receipt.
A couple things I had to ask about were how to properly call the substring to either assign it or print out certain
sections of the code without damaging the remainder of my code, as well as how to correctly 
range the random (since I am not used to Java's method of extending the range; compared to Python's; which I believe is 
inherently easier.)
